"""citation_verifier.py — THE enforcement layer.

Every persona reaction and unintended-consequence flag in this project
comes from a Finding with a claimed (doc_id, section_id, quote). This
module is what stops that from being "plausible-sounding roleplay": it
deterministically checks the claimed quote against the actual indexed
corpus text before a Finding is ever displayed as verified. A citation
that doesn't check out is downgraded, not hidden -- the user sees exactly
what failed and why, the same "don't hide the failure mode" discipline as
GhostTrace's OFAC screening (candidates, not confirmed) and PatientFusion's
entity resolution (missed merge visible, not silently dropped).

Verification has two tiers:
  1. The (doc_id, section_id) pair must exist in the index at all.
  2. The claimed quote must be a normalized substring of that chunk's real
     text, or a near-verbatim match (SequenceMatcher ratio >= the
     NEAR_VERBATIM_THRESHOLD) of some substring of it. Paraphrase that
     isn't a substantial verbatim excerpt does NOT verify -- that is the
     whole point.
