"""scoring.py — deterministic scoring against real frameworks, with
explicit cited evidence for every point awarded or withheld.

Like consequences.py, these Findings quote the corpus directly rather than
asking Claude to generate a citation, so they are verified by construction.
Claude never sets a score here -- "Claude extracts, rules decide," the same
doctrine used across this portfolio (CFIUS Screener's TVC score, GhostTrace's
risk engine, PatientFusion's LACE index).
